      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Wayne Enterprises was officially created in the 19th century and thus is one of the oldest companies in the world.
        It began as a dozen merchant businesses started by Judge Solomon Wayne and his brother Joshua.
        With the money made, Judge Wayne essentially built Gotham City by hiring Cyrus Pinkney. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Judge Wayne's son and heir, Alan, used his father's wealth and turned both the Wayne Shipping and the Wayne Chemical companies into Gotham City.
        Wayne Manufacturing soon followed as the fourth branch of the company.
        All these companies were energized and powered by the world's Industrial Revolution and they kept changing: more branches were opened and built while
        others dwindled and were discarded. Along the years, it has developed from a merchant house to a large multinational conglomerate company that stands among the
        biggest in the world with only a few rivals such as LexCorp.
        <br>
        <br>
        Wayne Enterprises became a green company under the control of Patrick and Laura Wayne and has been environmentally conscious from that time forward.
        Even when environmentalism wasn't a fad or a necessity. Wayne Enterprises followed those ideals.
        At the turn of the 20th century, Wayne Enterprises was the city in many ways and even now they employ the largest part of the city's considerable workforce.
